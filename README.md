# Housing Price Prediction

This project involves predicting housing prices using a Linear Regression model. The dataset contains various features related to house characteristics and their corresponding prices.

## Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Binary feature mapping (`yes`/`no` to `1`/`0`).
   - One-hot encoding of categorical variables.
   - MinMax scaling for numeric features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation matrix to explore relationships between features.
   - Skewness analysis and visualization for `price` and `area`.
   - Boxplots and scatterplots to examine data distribution and relationships.

3. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression model trained on 80% of the data.
   - Model evaluated using RÂ² score on both training and testing sets.

4. **Residual Analysis**
   - Analysis of residuals to ensure model accuracy and check for issues like heteroscedasticity.
